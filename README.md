## Simonuel

## What is simonuel?
Simonuel is game based on the popular simon game. The name is a combination of "Simon" and "Emmanuel", the ladder being the original developer behind the simonuel. This is a version completely rewritten for Arduino use (originally made in assembler for old microcontrollers).
## How to play :
The hardware needed is an Arduino ATMEGA328P microcontroller, 4-input pullup buttons and 4 resistors & LEDs

The LEDs are turned on randomly, and create a melody you recreate by pressing the corresponding button and that gets harder everytime another beat is added.

## To-do :

There do seems to be a certain instability to the game, with success rate of playback feature wildly varying between runs

## Author(s)
The entire code was written by me (suroxdesigns) and some parts inspired by friends advice ( looking @ u Dico) and various resources online.
